Changes:

- Used 520g spelt flour (from Azure Market, ultra unifine unbleached spelt flour)
- Used 365g water mixed with the 90g starter (reading indicated that spelt flour is easier to work with a lower hydration; dough this time around was pretty wet, so going down from 70% hydration to 67% may have been a better choice)
- Used 1.5tsp salt
- Added 85g sunflower seeds (raw)
- Added 1tbsp cinnamon (kirkland signature ground saigon cinnamon)
- Add Trader Joe's Organic Multigrain Hot Cereal, uncooked, to the banneton (blend of whole grain rye, barley, oats, and wheat)

1. Measured out spelt flour into large metal mixing bowl, added salt and sunflower seeds. Mixed 365g water with 90g of starter (100% hydration) until well combined, then added it to flour and mixed until flour was all hydrated. Let it sit for 20 minutes in the bowl covered by a damp towel.
2. Did 4 sets of stretch and folds, spaced 20 minutes apart.
3. Let the dough sit and rise overnight (covered), 9:25pm until 7:45am.
4. Put the dough on a floured counter to shape (had clearly risen compared to last night), and rolled the top in some of the multigrain cereal before putting in the banneton to rest in the fridge.
5. An hour later, put the bread in the oven to bake. Oven had reached about 475 degrees Fahrenheit (hotter than before). Scored the bread with a "leaf/fern" pattern of several diagonal cuts on each side
6. Baked 28 minutes covered, and 10 minutes uncovered in the dutch oven, convection on.

Results: Coming out of the oven, it was a nice golden brown. The toasted oats on top looked nice; the scores didn't open up quite as expected (cuts weren't consistent depth/length and oats on top made scoring an uninterrupted line more difficult) with some opening quite a lot, and others less. The ears formed by some of the larger ones were very dark. Uncut the crust seemed pretty solid, and knocking on the bottom of the loaf had a hollow sound. Cutting into the loaf, the crust is a nice thickness and toughness (french bread, some crackle), and from the crumb it looks like some good gas/air bubbles formed -- much less dense than the previous 2 loaves, though trying to remove it from the mixing bowl for shaping was tricky so that might have resulted in deflating the dough more than it should have been. Raw sunflower seeds are okay, toasted probably would have been better for flavor/texture. Great with some fruit jam or jelly spread on top of a slice of warm bread.
