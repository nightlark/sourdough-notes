This bread took inspiration from the cooked flour used in the Tuscan bread recipe mentioned above. The book describes cooking the cooked flour paste as having gelatinized starches that release flavors that give it a "distinct quality". It seemed like it may have also had some effect on the texture of the bread (softer, smaller crumb?). However, unlike actual Tuscan bread, I didn't make this loaf salt-free; maybe for the next attempt. In general I tried to keep the ratios of flour and water roughly the same as the basic sourdough recipe I've been more or less following of 520g flour + 365-400g water. I had wanted to try misting the top of the bread and flinging flour across as described in the Tuscan bread recipe from the book, but forgot to do it in the morning (in part due to being out of parchment paper, and not wanting to attempt that while the loaf was in a heated dutch oven).

Changes:

- Cooked flour paste made by pouring 340g boiling water over 220g bread flour and stirring vigoriously until the flour is hydrated making a thick, smooth paste
- Used 100g of sourdough starter
- 300g of bread flour in addition to cooked flour paste (could try whole wheat later)
- Added 60g of water in addition to cooked flour paste (next time, this needs to be slightly higher to get the dough to a better consistency without chunks of cooked flour paste)
- Used 1.5tsp salt
- Semolina flour for the bottom of the loaf

1. Made the cooked flour paste the night before (2022-04-11) and let cool covered overnight.
2. Mixed sourdough starter with additional water. Added to a bowl with cooked flour paste and the additional flour. Stirred for a while trying to get it slightly sticky or tacky.
3. Did 4 sets of stretch and folds between 2-4:30pm (a bit over 30 minutes apart on average)
4. Let the dough rest in the oven with the light on for a bit to warm it up (speed up the process to work better with sleep schedule) and wait until it doubled in size.
5. At 11pm or so, shaped the dough, put it in a floured banneton and refrigerated it over night for proofing.
6. Preheated the oven with convection off to 515 degrees Fahrenheit and the dutch oven inside starting at 7:25am.
7. Took the bread out of the fridge to let it warm up between 7:35am-8:35am.
8. Due to not being able to find parchment paper, sprinkled the bottom of the bread with semolina flour while it was still in the basket. Removed the dutch oven and dumped the dough directly into it; carefully cut a single score, then put the dutch oven back into the oven.
9. Baked 28 minutes covered at around 500 degrees Fahrenheit, and 10 minutes uncovered at 450 degrees Fahrenheit in the dutch oven, no convection.

Results: The ear formed a sharp edge, but there was also another random split. The bottom of the loaf and edge of the ear are pretty dark (considering using a lower temperature for future loaves). Overall tasted fine, the finished loaf seemed to have a smaller crumb (less airy and big holes); good with jam or jelly on top. At some point I'll have to try making the original Tuscan bread recipe in the book to get a basis for comparing future loaves made using cooked flour paste.
