Initial recipe: https://www.feastingathome.com/sourdough-bread/

Changes:

- Used ~400g whole wheat flour and ~120g all-purpose flour (520g total of flour)
- Added ~2-4 tsp caraway seeds (until it looked like a nice distribution)
- Let proof overnight for more than 10 hours (oops?)

1. Measured out flour into large metal mixing bowl. Mixed 385g water with 90g of starter (100% hydration) until well combined, then added it to flour and mixed until all flour was wet. Tasted a small bit of dough when washing hands and realized I forgot the salt. Added 2tsp salt and caraway seeds. Covered the bowl with a damp kitchen towel and let sit on the counter for 15 minutes.
2. Went to do first stretch and fold (pull corner of dough up and over, then rotate bowl 20-25 degrees and repeat). Let sit (covered) another 15 minutes and did the second stretch and fold.
3. Let proof overnight in covered bowl for 10+ hours (10:15pm until 9am).
4. Realized the banneton needs some preparation before use, so lined another metal mixing bowl with parchment paper. Lifted dough and let it fold under itself, rotated 90 degrees and repeated 2-3 more times. Overall dough was a bit stiff (maybe due to the whole wheat flour preferring higher hydration, or a bit underproofed).
5. Put the uncovered bowl with dough in the fridge for 5 hours during work. Around 1:30pm started preheating the oven with a dutch oven (lid on) at 520 degrees Fahrenheit with convection on.
6. Scored the bread with a lame (slightly angled) down the center. Put in the dutch oven and baked for 28 minutes with the lid on.
7. Removed the lid from the dutch oven and baked an addition 12 minutes.
8. Bread cooled ~2 hours before cutting into it. Still some warmth, overall tasted a bit like rye (likely due to caraway). Crust turned out nice, could have maybe gone a bit longer to get slightly darker but some of the edges along the ear from scoring was getting rather dark. Not very airy, but overall the crumb was satisfying (not overly dense).
