Initial recipe: https://www.feastingathome.com/sourdough-bread/

Changes:

- Used 350g whole wheat flour and 170g all-purpose flour (520g total of flour)
- Used 400g water mixed with the starter
- Added 125g raisins (soaked in a bowl of water with 2 drops of vanilla extract)
- Added 1tbsp cinnamon (kirkland signature ground saigon cinnamon)

1. Soaked raisins in water with a bit of vanilla extract for ~1.5 hours.
2. Measured out flour into large metal mixing bowl, added salt and cinnamon. Mixed 400g water with 90g of starter (100% hydration) until well combined, then added it to flour and mixed until flour was wet. Folded in raisins.
3. Three sets of stretch and folds, spaced about 15-18 minutes apart. Let sit overnight covered for 9 hour; dough felt firm with poke test and didn't look like it rose much -- put it in the oven with the light on to give it a warmer environment at 8:20am. About 1.5 hours later did the shaping/stretch and fold several times, and put it in a floured banneton in the fridge.
4. Oven reached about 460 degrees Fahrenheit. Scored bread with "window-pane/pound sign with a little x in the middle".
5. Baked in the covered dutch oven for 28 minutes, followed by 10 minutes uncovered with convection on the entire time (and likely about an extra minute with the oven off before it got taken out).
